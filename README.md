## 🎮 Game Concept

**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game. In this version:

- The computer randomly selects a word related to **Computer Science**.
- You try to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
- Each incorrect guess adds a part to the ASCII art hangman figure.
- The game ends when:
  - You correctly guess all the letters (🎉 You win!)
  - The hangman is fully drawn after too many wrong guesses (💀 You lose!)
